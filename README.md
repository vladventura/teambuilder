# Teambuilder
A place where developers can find others like them and build stuff together... sort of.

## Getting Started
There's no special requirements to work on this project besides having the fully functional [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), cloning this repo and then run `flutter install teambuilder`.

Confused? Just follow these easy steps (make sure you have git installed on your [Windows PC](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [Linux/Mac (just do brew install git)](https://brew.sh/) and also the Flutter SDK):

1. `git clone git@github.com:vladventura/teambuilder` inside the directory you want to keep your cloned repos in. I strongly recommend this.
2. `flutter install teambuilder` without doing `cd teambuilder` first; I repeat, **do NOT run this inside the cloned repo**.
3. open the directory on your preferred text editor (`code teambuilder` if you're on my team).

Voila. You're all set to contribute to this project. Thank you!
